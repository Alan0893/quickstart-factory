# Deploy Analysis Output Schema

Write `{state_dir}/deploy-analysis.yaml` with this structure:

```yaml
project_path: /absolute/path/to/project
namespace: target-namespace
deployment_method: helm | oc-apply | custom-script

# Mutually-exclusive OpenShift deployment variants found in project docs.
# Omit this field entirely when the project has only one OpenShift deployment path.

# High-level structure overview
structure_overview: |
  RAG pipeline quickstart with PostgreSQL for metadata, Redis for caching,
  embedding service for vector generation, and app-server as the main API.
  PostgreSQL and Redis are independent. Embedding service needs PostgreSQL
  for model config. App-server depends on all three.
